## Problem statement
Does climate change matter? 

Is greenhouse gas (GHG) emission contributing to the global warming? 

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states:
“Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era, driven largely by economic and population growth, and are now higher than ever. This has led to atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide that are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years. Their effects, together with those of other anthropogenic drivers, have been detected throughout the climate system and are extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.“

## Objectives
Developing an application that interactively:
 
. Visualizes emissions of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide (CO2​), methane (CH4​), and nitrous oxide (N2​O) for all countries.

. Tabulates share of different sectors including coal, oil, gas, gas flaring or cement in CO2 production for all countries.
 
. Forecasts CO2​ emission of 16 countries, leading the global economic output, for 2020-2025.
