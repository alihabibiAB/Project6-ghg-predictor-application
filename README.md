## Problem statement
Does climate change matter? 

Is greenhouse gas (GHG) emission contributing to the global warming? 

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states:
“Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era, driven largely by economic and population growth, and are now higher than ever. This has led to atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide that are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years. Their effects, together with those of other anthropogenic drivers, have been detected throughout the climate system and are extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.“

## Objectives
Developing an application that interactively:
 
- Visualizes emissions of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>2</sub>), and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) for all countries.

- Tabulates share of different sectors including coal, oil, gas, gas flaring or cement in CO<sub>2</sub> production for all countries.
 
- Forecasts CO<sub>2</sub> emission of 16 countries, leading the global economic output, for 2020-2025.

## Recommendations for future

- CO<sub>2</sub> emission has an increasing trend in next 5 years for the most countries. 

- Key players in CO<sub>2</sub> emission are: Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, and US

- The performance of this model can be improved by incorporating additional parameters. 

- A rigorous policy has be considered by key players to reduce the amount of CO2 existing in the atmosphere. CCUS
